#Class Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data"

The following repository contains the files necessary to perform an analysis on the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" dataset.
After performing analysis, the code will tidy the tada and output it to tidy.csv

Here are the steps to run the R script:

Make sure you have the following files in the same directory as your R script:

	features.txt
	subject_train.txt
	subject_test.txt
	X_train.txt
	X_test.txt
	y_train.txt
	y_test.txt

If you do not have the files, you can download them from here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

You can then run run_analysis.R. Make sure you have the reshape2 package installed.

The tidied data set is located in tidy.csv
